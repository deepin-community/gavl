Description: don't fail on missing doxygen
 Debian does not install doxygen on arch-dependent only builds.
 Not having doxygen installed is a fatal error (unless the --without-doxygen
 option is specified, which we don't want to do since we do want to build the
 docs in the full builds)
 .
 Alternatively we could have used something like override_dh_auto_configure-{arch,indep}.
 Check how libbluray is doing that..
